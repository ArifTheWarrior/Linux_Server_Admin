Input: D={x1,...,xi,...,Xn}
Output: Random Forest Evaluation Matrics
Method:

1.DT = âˆ…;
2.Performe k-means clustering with n_clusters
3.Generate random binary labels (0,1)
3.for each cluster_id do 
4.   create a cluster mask based on the cluster_id mask =               y_kmeans == cluster_id
5.    extract cluster_labels and cluster_feature 
6.    Train Decision Tree DT[cluster_id] with cluster_features and 
      cluster_labels
7.end for
8.Initialize  a random forest with estimators=number_of_cluster
9.for tree in decision_trees
10. Each tree Cluster assignments as feature for Random Forest 
11.  Split data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
12.  Predic the test set using Random Forest y_pred_rf =rf.predict                                           (X_test)
13.  Evaluate Random Forest performance:
       Calculate accuracy_rf,precision_rf,recall_rf,f1_rf
